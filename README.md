# What is this repo?

This repo is part of the Pins and Curves project, read more at https://pinsandcurves.app

It contains several panel plugins that make up a timeline editor for p5js:
- a timeline panel
- a code editor panel
- a signals panel
- a preview panel
- a (unreleased) copilot panel

Currently, this should be thought of as a prototype: the code is messy. 
This will be improved once the project finds its direction.

Importantly, it should be understood that this repo is not standalone.
To make up the final experience seen in the demo above, it runs together with two other repos:

Main application that can spawn iframe panels and mediates communication between them:

Background services running in encapsulated WASM modules:
